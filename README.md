# pyconmy2015 - Unit Test Workshop

## Improve Quality of Life through Unit Testing

Hi all, you've signed up for workshop and here's the estimates of our exploration in improving our quality of life as a programmer :)

- The format will be an initial talk, where I'll be giving some background on why unit testing, and then we will proceed with some simple programs and see how unit testing can improve our quality of code.

- Coding yourself is optional, however absolutely fantastic if you decided to follow along.

- Questions are welcome at any time, just speak up during the session.

- Depending on the number of participants on that day, I may not be able to help everyone individually with coding, but do feel free to get help from your neighbour if there's any asssistance needed.

- If you wish to run the code examples yourself, you will need a Linux system or a Linux VM running on top of your Windows or Mac OS X system. For details, I will update this README in this week before Thursday, 20 August 2015.

Hope to see you and let's get excited with our journey to the galaxy of Python.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository in your computer

```
git clone git@github.com:kiawin/pyconmy2015.git

```

2. We will be using a VM (virtual machine) to write unit tests

```
cd pyconmy2015
vagrant up
vagrant ssh

```

3. Within the VM, you may access the cloned materials in /vagrant

```
cd /vagrant

```
